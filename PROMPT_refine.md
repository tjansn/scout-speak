0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Analyze if all information for implementation is given. Research where necessary and Use up to 250 Sonnet subagents to load info from URLs into context.
0c. Refine specifications with implementation critical details.
IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: Look a `goal.md` Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/FILENAME.md.
